# Ancient DNA and the dispersal of domestic cats into Europe

In this hands-on session we will analyse the data from the study of De Martino et al., in which 70 low-coverage (∼0.07-fold to ∼1.39-fold) ancient genomes of cats dated to the last 10 thousand years were analysed to investigate the introduction of domestic cats to Europe and gene flow across time between wild and domestic cats.

Here you will find the jupyter noteobook file, the fasta file containing mtDNA data abd the analysis.R script.
